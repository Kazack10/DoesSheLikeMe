  "description": "The creature known as man is quick to misunderstand.
The same applies to the the pure middle-schooler Yokoyama-kun: A diligent fellow who does his infirmary duty properly.
"You're so nice. Thank you." The one to say that to him was his classmate Nishino-san, so Yokoyama-kun ended up thinking: ("Isn't she only nice to me?!" )
